 * How long a single request to Inngest may take before it is abandoned.
 *
 * The SDK sets no timeout of its own, so an unresponsive host would hold the
 * caller open until the platform terminated it. That matters most on a request
 * path: `groups.create` sends an event and falls back to generating sessions
 * inline when the send fails (STATE.md D163), and a fallback that only triggers
 * after the whole request has been killed is not a fallback.
 *
 * The SDK still retries a failed send internally, so this bounds each attempt
 * rather than the total — which is the part that was unbounded.
